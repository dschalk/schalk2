    <p> The Blog (linked above) contains information and ideas where I can easily access them, for my own investigations and creations, and to share with others. </p>

    <p> Recursive Closures is a work in progress, with nine pages mature enough for publication. They showcase the use of what I call m-M(x) closures. It is written not only for computer progammers, but for anyone who finds them informative and interesting. The virtual Rubik's cube was made with online solving in mind.</p>
