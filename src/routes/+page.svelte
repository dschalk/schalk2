    <p> Blog (linked above) is a disorganized collection of miscellaneous ideas. It's online so I can refer to items in it in email exchanges, or during phone conversations. </p>

    <p> Recursive Closures is a work in progress, with nine pages mature enough for publication. They showcase the use of what I call m-M(x) closures. It's written for computer progammers, but others might find some of the pages interesting. I tried to make the virtual Rubik's cube easy to rearrange and solve. </p>
